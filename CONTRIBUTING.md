**Contribution guidelines**
Welcome Contributors!
Thank you for considering contributing to the centralized repository. This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to the development of Simple Interest calculator.

**Code style**
Please follow the coding style and conventions used in the existing codebase. This helps maintain consistency across the project.

**Documentation**
Ensure that your contributions are well-documented. Include comments in your code where necessary and provide a clear and concise description of your changes in the pull request.

**Testing**
Before submitting a pull request, make sure your changes have been tested thoroughly. Include relevant test cases and ensure that existing tests pass.

**Issue tracker**
How to Contribute in Issues
      For any issue, there are fundamentally three ways an individual can contribute:
      
      By opening the issue for discussion: For instance, if you believe that you have uncovered a bug in Project Sample, creating a new issue in the Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/Legit-Info issue tracker is the way to report it.
      By helping to triage the issue: This can be done either by providing supporting details (a test case that demonstrates a bug), or providing suggestions on how to address the issue.
      By helping to resolve the issue: Typically this is done either in the form of demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more often, by opening a Pull Request that changes some bit of something in Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/Legit-Info in a concrete and reviewable manner.
      
**Triaging a Bug Report**
      Once an issue has been opened, it is not uncommon for there to be discussion around it. Some contributors may have differing opinions about the issue, including whether the behavior being seen is a bug or a feature. This discussion is part of the process and should be kept focused, helpful, and professional.
      
      Short, clipped responses—that provide neither additional context nor supporting detail—are not helpful or professional. To many, such responses are simply annoying and unfriendly.
      
      Contributors are encouraged to help one another make forward progress as much as possible, empowering one another to solve issues collaboratively. If you choose to comment on an issue that you feel either is not a problem that needs to be fixed, or if you encounter information in an issue that you feel is incorrect, explain why you feel that way with additional supporting context, and be willing to be convinced that you may be wrong. By doing so, we can often reach the correct outcome much faster.

**Resolving a Bug Report**
    In the vast majority of cases, issues are resolved by opening a Pull Request. The process for opening and reviewing a Pull Request isa similar to that of opening and triaging issues, but carries with it a necessary review and approval workflow that ensures that the proposed changes meet the minimal quality and functional guidelines of the Project Sample project.
    
**Code review**
  All contributions will go through a code review process. Be open to feedback and be willing to make changes if necessary. Code reviews help maintain code quality and consistency.
  Thank you for your contribution!
